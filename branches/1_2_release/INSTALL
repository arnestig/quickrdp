To compile and install quickrdp on Linux systems, follow these few steps. Please be aware that wxWidgets libraries are required and are already packaged on most popular Linux distributions. Visit http://www.wxwidgets.org/ for more information.

  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package source code.
  2. as root issue 'make' to compile the package and then 'make install' to install all data files to the correct location.
  3. type 'quickrdp' to launch the program.

If you are building quickrdp for development and don't want to install data files into /usr/share you can issue 'make devel' when compiling. This will define the DATA_PATH used by the project to "", causing it to use the local data folder instead of /usr/share.
