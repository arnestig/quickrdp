\fBquickrdp\fP is a connection manager program for your remote desktop, telnet
or SSH connections. Makes it easy to keep track of all your connections.
Write your own perl scripts and execute them on your connections,
connect to all hosts selected with one command, easily locate your
connections with a simple search bar.

Used with your own favorite RDP, SSH or telnet application, tailor the
arguments passed to the program of your choice to gain the most of QuickRDP.
.PP
\fBExternal applications and command-line arguments\fP
.br
Remote desktop connections are currently executed by tsclient, only the connection file is passed as argument to tsclient when executing an RDP connection.
SSH and telnet connections uses specific command settings when executing. What commands and arguments are being executed can be customized under \fBSettings -> Preferences\fP.
Commandline-arguments sent to the telnet and ssh application will be parsed before sent.

Example: A connection with hostname \fItelnet.example.com\fP and username \fIfoobar\fP connecting with the argument string \fB"-telnet %username%@%hostname%"\fP would expand to \fB"-telnet foobar@telnet.example.com"\fP.

To avoid expanding part of the argument if a specific string is \fBempty\fP you can define this using brackets '{' and '}'.

Example: A connection without a password would expand the following argument \fB"-ssh {%username%@}%hostname%{ -pw %password%}"\fP to this: \fB"-ssh foobar@ssh.example.com"\fP.
