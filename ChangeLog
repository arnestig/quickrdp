quickrdp 2.0 - 2012-10-10
 New features
 ------------
 * Tab support added. You can now keep different groups of connections in
 tabs. By default ctrl+t opens a new tab and ctrl+w closes it. Cycle between
 tabs using tab+ctrl or clicking on them. This can be adjusted in the settings
 menu.
 * Connection status added. QuickRDP will launch a TCP connect scan against
 the target and report the status of the connection. By default the automatic
 scan is disabled. Check the settings page for how to setup the connection
 checker. If you don't want QuickRDP to automatically scan your targets the
 manual connection check will work well for you. Bind some hotkey to it in the
 settings page.

 Bug fixes
 ---------
 * Fixed some bugs causing the connection list to be reloaded even when not changing anything in the list. So when closing a properties or new connection page the view will not be reloaded.
 * Fixed bug causing Commands to loose their shortcut modifier when saving them.
 * Fixed bug causing properties window not opening when clicking on the big properties button.
 * Style bug fixed in about dialog.
 * Fixed a bug where commands would be executed outside of the connection list. (Issue #63)
 * Fixed potential problem in the versionchecker where CURL was not removed if the request failed.

Enjoy this new release and post any feedback or bugs you find. ;)
