\fBquickrdp\fP is a connection manager program for your remote desktop, Telnet,
SSH and VNC connections. Makes it easy to keep track of all your connections. 
Some key features of quickrdp: custom commands against connections, 
connection status indication, "connect when ready" - connects to the target 
when a connection can be established, network scanner which can convert 
scanned hosts to connections, netmask calculator and more.

Used with your own favorite RDP, SSH, telnet or VNC application, tailor the 
arguments passed to the program of your choice to gain the most of quickrdp.

\fBExternal applications and command\(hyline arguments\fP
.br
Remote desktop connections are currently executed by tsclient, only the connection file is passed as argument to tsclient when executing an RDP connection.
SSH and telnet connections uses specific command settings when executing. What commands and arguments are being executed can be customized under \fBSettings \-> Preferences\fP.
Commandline\(hyarguments sent to the telnet and ssh application will be parsed before sent.

Example: A connection with hostname \fItelnet.example.com\fP and username \fIfoobar\fP connecting with the argument string \fB"\-telnet %username%@%hostname%"\fP would expand to \fB"\-telnet foobar@telnet.example.com"\fP.

To avoid expanding part of the argument if a specific string is \fBempty\fP you can define this using brackets '{' and '}'.

Example: A connection without a password would expand the following argument \fB"\-ssh {%username%@}%hostname%{ \-pw %password%}"\fP to this: \fB"\-ssh foobar@ssh.example.com"\fP.
